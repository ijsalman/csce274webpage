        <h3 className="margin-top-1">This course aims at introducing to robotics from a computing perspective. After an overview of different types of robots, 
            sensors, and locomotion, algorithms for robotic perception, planning, navigation, localization, and manipulation are presented. 
            The students will have the chance to implement some of the concepts seen in the class on a mobile robot (Duckiebot). 
            The instructor would draw from his experiences in robotic research to enrich the material with aspects of active research problems,
             such as: multi-robot exploration for search and rescue; environmental coral reef monitoring using underwater robots; etc.</h3>
